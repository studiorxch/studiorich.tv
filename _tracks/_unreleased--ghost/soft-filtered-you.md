  [Intro]  
  [soft room-tone + faint subway platform noise layered under vinyl hiss]  
  [vocal fragment: “are you still here?” whispered in Korean → reverb-panned]  
  [pad chord: Fmaj7 with warm filter sweep + lofi crackle]

  [Verse A]  
  [minimal house beat, 118 BPM — pillow-soft kick, brushed clap, distant hi-hats]  
  [bassline = round sine sub, pulsing like breath — sidechained gently to the kick]  
  [synth melody: glassy keys, 3-note pattern looped w/ delay]  
  [vocal overlay: soft Korean/English whisper phrases processed through chorus FX]

  [Bridge A]  
  [beat filters down — only pad + ghostly hi-hat remain]  
  [vocal returns: “you are not me…” reversed + spread wide]  
  [texture: tape noise rises slightly like emotional tension]

  [Verse B]  
  [groove deepens with layered clap + shaker]  
  [synth chords cycle: Fmaj7 → Gm7 → Dm9, subtle shift toward melancholy]  
  [vocal becomes more rhythmic: whisper cadence interlocks with groove]

  [Bridge B]  
  [beat drops out — only ambient pad and whisper fragments remain]  
  [glitch delay pulls last vocal phrase across stereo field]  
  [emotional apex held in silence]

  [Outro]  
  [return of soft kick + vinyl loop]  
  [last whispered line: “다시 만날 수 있을까?” → trailing echo into tape click]

  ambient minimal house groove, subway noise, vinyl hiss, Fmaj7-based chords, jazz-tinged progressions, Korean-English whisper vocals, delayed motifs, beat drop bridges, tape noise and filter sweeps
